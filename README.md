CashRegisterApp

About app 

We all might went to Shopping Malls, Reliance Fresh or Big Bazaar. When we are done with our Purchasing and went for checkout or Bill, we see those Aunty's to see their screen and give the money. Do anyone know what they are looking at on those screens in front of them??
Yes, you are right!
They have seen the same which I built.

WORKING

When your bill is made, its most probably dont come in round figure. And when you give the money, you also dont use chillar to match the exact amount. So,this App will take Input of "Bill Amount" and "Cash given". On the bais of Balance left, it will display the no.of notes (of 2000,500,100,20,10,5,1) you should give to match the exact balance Amount. Beacause its not feasible to calculate for large amounts when there is Big Line. To ease them, this App can be used. This will calculate & display notes(amount) to be given in descending order.
